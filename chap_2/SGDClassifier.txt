What is a SGDClassifier ?
	Linear classifier with a schoastic gradient descent working on it
		--> Generally, we have a linear classifier, and we then use a min/max function on it.
			--> In this case we are using Gradient descent
				--> It can be of 3 types
					1. Batch
					2. Schoastic
					3. Idk, but uses both of the upper one 
			--> Linear classifier can be SVC and what not....
